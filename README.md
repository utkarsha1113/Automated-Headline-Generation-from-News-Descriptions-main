# Automated-Headline-Generation-from-News-Descriptions-main
## Project Overview

This project focuses on generating headlines automatically from news descriptions using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging machine learning models, the goal is to produce concise and relevant headlines based on the provided news article descriptions.

## Project Files

- **requirements.txt**: Contains the list of dependencies required to run the project.
- **train_title_generation.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the training process for the headline generation model, including data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **train_title_generation.py**: Python script used to train the model outside of the Jupyter notebook environment for automation and scalability.

## Requirements

To set up the project, install the necessary dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Key Features

- *Data Preprocessing*: Cleans and prepares the news descriptions for model input.
- *Model Training*: Uses a transformer-based or sequence-to-sequence model to generate headlines.
- *Evaluation*: Assesses the model performance using standard metrics like BLEU or ROUGE scores.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd Automated-Headline-Generation


2. Install the dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Train the model using the Jupyter notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook train_title_generation.ipynb


Or, run the Python script:

bash
python train_title_generation.py


## Model Architecture

The model used in this project is based on a sequence-to-sequence architecture, potentially enhanced by attention mechanisms or transformer-based models like BART or T5, designed to handle text summarization tasks effectively.

## Future Improvements

- Fine-tuning the model on more specific datasets.
- Implementing reinforcement learning techniques to improve headline relevance.
- Developing a web interface for real-time headline generation.
